Title: Detecting Isotope, Adduct and Homologue Relations in LC-MS Data 
Version: 2.2
Date: 2022-01-13
Author: Martin Loos
Maintainer: Martin Loos <mloos@looscomputing.ch>
Description: Screening a HRMS data set for peaks related by (1) isotope patterns, (2) different adducts of the same molecule and/or (3) homologue series. The resulting isotopic pattern and adduct groups can then be combined to so-called components, with homologue series information attached. Also allows plotting and filtering HRMS data for mass defects, frequent m/z distances and components vs. non-components.
